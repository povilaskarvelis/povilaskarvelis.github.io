I am a postdoctoral research fellow in the [Cognitive Network Modelling Lab](https://cognemo.com) at the [Krembil Centre for Neuroinformatics](https://www.camh.ca/en/science-and-research/institutes-and-centres/krembil-centre-for-neuroinformatics) at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, in Toronto, Canada.

I develop computational models with the aim to re-conceptualize mental disorders and their treatment. I am driven by a vision of a multidisciplinary and personalized model of mental health that is aligned with a proper understanding of human nature.

My recent work tackles methodological challenges in studying individual differences and validating novel psychometric instruments (eg, see [Karvelis et al. (2023)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0149763423001069)). Many widely used cognitive tests suffer from poor reliability and validity, creating a major bottleneck for both research and clinical translation. Despite its far-reaching implications, these issues remain largely overlooked. I believe it stems from broader systemic problems in academic research, where chasing statistical significance takes precedence over optimizing for meaningful effect sizes and practical significance. To address this, I have developed an interactive web tool, which helps researchers interpret findings and plan studies through the lens of real-world predictive utility (see [www.e2p-simulator.com](https://www.e2p-simulator.com)). By tackling these root problems, I hope to amplify the efficiency and impact of all other research.

More generally, I am interested in using computational tools to solve real-world problems while simultaneously exploring fundamental questions about the mind, intelligence, and knowledge.
