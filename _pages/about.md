I am a postdoctoral research fellow in the [Cognitive Network Modelling Lab](https://cognemo.com) at the [Krembil Centre for Neuroinformatics](https://www.camh.ca/en/science-and-research/institutes-and-centres/krembil-centre-for-neuroinformatics) at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, in Toronto, Canada.

I work at the intersection of computational neuroscience, psychometrics, and biostatistics, developing methods and tools to advance prediction models in precision psychiatry. My work spans multiple scales - from developing computational models and gamified assessments for specific disorders to addressing systemic problems in research practices across the field.

At the disorder level, I have developed Bayesian computational models for diverse conditions including psychosis, autism ([Karvelis et al., 2018](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.34115)), and suicidality ([Karvelis et al., 2022](https://doi.org/10.5334/cpsy.80)). Such models could provide novel computational markers for diagnosis and treatment - yet their promise depends on overcoming methodological barriers that affect the entire field.

At the field level, I have shown that novel computational assays often suffer from poor psychometric properties due to inadequate research designs, and provided a roadmap for developing reliable, valid and clinically effective instruments ([Karvelis et al., 2023](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neubiorev.2023.105137)). I have also derived mathematical equations to quantify how measurement reliability affects observed observed group differences ([Karvelis & Diaconescu, 2025](https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2025.1592658)), providing researchers with tools to account for these overlooked effects. Additionally, I have documented methodological problems with the application of machine learning for treatment response prediction in depression ([Karvelis et al., 2022](https://doi.org/10.1162/netn_a_00233)), where overfitting is the rule rather than the exception. These issues create fundamental bottlenecks for both research and clinical translation, yet remain overlooked due to academic incentives that prioritize statistical significance and positive results over real-world utility.

To address these broader systemic problems, I have developed an open-source web tool ([www.e2p-simulator.com](https://www.e2p-simulator.com)) that helps researchers interpret findings and plan studies through the lens of real-world predictive utility. Though motivated by challenges in precision psychiatry, it can be applied broadly across biomedical and behavioral sciences and beyond.

More generally, I am interested in using computational tools to solve real-world problems while simultaneously exploring fundamental questions about the mind, intelligence, and knowledge.
