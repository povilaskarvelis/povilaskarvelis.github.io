I am a postdoctoral research fellow in the [Cognitive Network Modelling Lab](https://cognemo.com) at the [Krembil Centre for Neuroinformatics](https://www.camh.ca/en/science-and-research/institutes-and-centres/krembil-centre-for-neuroinformatics) at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, in Toronto, Canada.

I develop computational models with the aim to re-conceptualize mental disorders and their treatment. I am driven by a vision of a multidisciplinary and personalized model of mental health that is aligned with a proper understanding of human nature.

My recent work tackles methodological challenges in studying individual differences and validating novel psychometric instruments. Many widely used cognitive tests lack reliability and construct validity, creating a major bottleneck for both research and clinical translation. Despite its far-reaching implications, this issue remains very much underappreciated. I believe it stems from broader systemic problems in academic research, where chasing statistical significance takes attention away from effect sizes, predictive power, and practical impact. My goal is to fix these problems and to make research impactful again.

More generally, I am interested in using computational tools to solve real-world problems while simultaneously tackling fundamental questions about the mind, intelligence, and knowledge.
