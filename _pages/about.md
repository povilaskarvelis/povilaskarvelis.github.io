I am a postdoctoral research fellow at the [Krembil Centre for Neuroinformatics](https://www.camh.ca/en/science-and-research/institutes-and-centres/krembil-centre-for-neuroinformatics) at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, in Toronto, Canada.

I work on the development of computational models with the aim to re-conceptualize mental disorders and their treatment. I am driven by a vision of a multidisciplinary and personalized model of mental health that is aligned with a proper understanding of human nature. 

My most recent work addresses methodological challenges in studying individual differences and validating cognitive assessments. Many routinely used cognitive tests show poor reliability and construct validity, which creates a huge bottleneck not only for productive research but also for clinical translation or any other real-world applications. The extent of this problem remains very much underappreciated. This also reflects a more general issue in academic research where too much emphasis is placed on demonstrating the statistical significance of theoretical constructs rather than on effects sizes and their practical implications. It is starting to seem that in order to bring computational technologies to mental health we will have to simultaneously fix how academic research is done. That, more or less, is what I am trying to do.

More generally, I am interested in using computational tools to solve real-world problems while simultaneously tackling fundamental questions about the mind and intelligence. For example, integrating AI into the process of knowledge generation, building online research platforms to speed up research cycle and ensure reproducibility, adapting methodologies from cognitive sciences to build tools for testing reliability and generalizability of AI agents, establishing an instrumentalist framework for operationalizing complicated concepts such as free will and consciousness.
