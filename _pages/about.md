I am a postdoctoral research fellow at the [Krembil Centre for Neuroinformatics](https://www.camh.ca/en/science-and-research/institutes-and-centres/krembil-centre-for-neuroinformatics) at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, in Toronto, Canada.

I work on the development of computational models with the aim to re-conceptualize mental disorders and their treatment. I am driven by a vision of a multidisciplinary and personalized model of psychiatry that is aligned with the deepest understanding of human nature. 

My most recent work addresses methodological challenges in studying individual differences and validating psychometric assessments - which are the main bottlenecks for both research and real-life applications. My work is grounded in scientific instrumentalism, which provides a meta-framework that can flexibly accommodate all theoretical frameworks without making unnecessary ontological commitments and is perfectly aligned with the ultimate goal of improving the quality of life. In other words, "all models are wrong, but some are useful".
