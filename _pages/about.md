I am a postdoctoral research fellow at the [Krembil Centre for Neuroinformatics](https://www.camh.ca/en/science-and-research/institutes-and-centres/krembil-centre-for-neuroinformatics) at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, in Toronto, Canada.

I work on the development of computational models with the aim to re-conceptualize mental disorders and their treatment. I am driven by a vision of a multidisciplinary and personalized model of mental health that is aligned with a proper understanding of human nature. 

My recent work focuses on methodological challenges in studying individual differences and validating novel psychometric instruments. Many widely used cognitive tests lack reliability and construct validity, creating a major bottleneck for both research and clinical translation. Despite its far-reaching implications, this issue remains underappreciated, limiting progress in neuroscience and mental health. More broadly, this reflects a systemic problem in academia: an overemphasis on statistical significance at the expense of effect sizes, predictive power, and practical impact. Addressing these limitations is not just a technical challenge, it requires rethinking how research is conducted.

More generally, I am interested in using computational tools to solve real-world problems while simultaneously tackling fundamental questions about the mind, intelligence, and knowledge. For example, I am interested in developing robust ways of integrating AI into the process of knowledge generation, building online research platforms that can speed up the research cycle and ensure reproducibility, establishing an instrumentalist framework for operationalizing complicated concepts such as free will and consciousness, etc.
