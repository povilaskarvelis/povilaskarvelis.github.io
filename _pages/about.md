I work on the development of computational models with the aim to re-conceptualize mental disorders and their treatment. I am driven by a vision of a multidisciplinary and personalized model of psychiatry that is aligned with the deepest understanding of human nature. My most important work addresses methodological challenges in studying individual differences and validating psychometric assessments. Throughout my work I rely on scientific instrumentalism as a meta-framework that is naturally aligned with clinical translation goals. 

I currently hold a postdoctoral research fellow position at the [Krembil Centre for Neuroinformatics](https://www.camh.ca/en/science-and-research/institutes-and-centres/krembil-centre-for-neuroinformatics) at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, in Toronto, Canada.
