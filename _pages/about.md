I am a postdoctoral research fellow in the [Cognitive Network Modelling Lab](https://cognemo.com) at the [Krembil Centre for Neuroinformatics](https://www.camh.ca/en/science-and-research/institutes-and-centres/krembil-centre-for-neuroinformatics) at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, in Toronto, Canada.

I work at the intersection of computational neuroscience, psychometrics, and biostatistics, developing methods and tools to advance prediction models in precision psychiatry. My work spans multiple scales - from developing computational models and gamified cognitive assessments for specific disorders to addressing systemic problems in research practices.

At the disorder level, I have developed and experimentally tested Bayesian models for diverse conditions including psychosis, autism ([Karvelis et al., 2018](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.34115)), and suicidality ([Karvelis et al., 2022](https://doi.org/10.5334/cpsy.80)). Such models could provide novel computational markers for diagnosis and treatment - yet their promise depends on overcoming methodological barriers that affect the entire field.

At the field level, I have shown that novel computational assays often suffer from poor psychometric properties due to inadequate research designs, and provided a roadmap for developing reliable, valid and clinically effective instruments ([Karvelis et al., 2023](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neubiorev.2023.105137)). I have also shown how poor measurement reliability problems extend to group differences designs and derived a set of equations to account for these effects ([Karvelis & Diaconescu, 2025](https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2025.1592658)). I have also documented common methodological problems when applying machine learning for treatment response prediction ([Karvelis et al., 2022](https://doi.org/10.1162/netn_a_00233)). These issues create fundamental bottlenecks for both research and clinical translation, yet remain overlooked due to academic incentives that prioritize statistical significance and positive results over real-world utility.

To address these broader systemic problems, I have developed an open-source web tool, [www.e2p-simulator.com](https://www.e2p-simulator.com), that helps researchers interpret findings and plan studies through the lens of real-world predictive utility.

More generally, I am interested in using computational tools to solve real-world problems while simultaneously exploring fundamental questions about the mind, intelligence, and knowledge.
