I am a postdoctoral research fellow at the [Krembil Centre for Neuroinformatics](https://www.camh.ca/en/science-and-research/institutes-and-centres/krembil-centre-for-neuroinformatics) at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, in Toronto, Canada.

I work on the development of computational models with the aim to re-conceptualize mental disorders and their treatment. I am driven by a vision of a multidisciplinary and personalized model of psychiatry that is aligned with the deepest understanding of human nature. 

My most recent work addresses methodological challenges in studying individual differences and validating cognitive assessments. Many routinely used cognitive tests show poor reliability and validity, which is a huge bottleneck not only for productive research but also for clinical translation or any other real-world applications. The extent of this problem still remains much underappreciated. 

Philosophically, my work is grounded in scientific instrumentalism ("all models are wrong, but some are useful"), which is the most productive meta-framework to operate under. Instead of endlessly studying poorly-defined scientific constructs, instrumentalism urges us to operationalize such constructs more systematically and to have more clarity on how our research can get us closer to the ultimate goal: improving the quality of life. The only real knowledge is useful knowledge.
 
Get in touch if you'd like to join forces in bringing psychometric soundness to neuroscience and psychiatry (or if you'd like to join my instrumentalism cult)!
