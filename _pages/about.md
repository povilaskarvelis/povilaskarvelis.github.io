I am a postdoctoral research fellow at the [Krembil Centre for Neuroinformatics](https://www.camh.ca/en/science-and-research/institutes-and-centres/krembil-centre-for-neuroinformatics) at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, in Toronto, Canada.

I work on the development of computational models with the aim to re-conceptualize mental disorders and their treatment. I am driven by a vision of a multidisciplinary and personalized model of psychiatry that is aligned with the deepest understanding of human nature. 

My most recent work addresses methodological challenges in studying individual differences and in validating cognitive assessments. Many routinely used cognitive tests show poor reliability and validity, which creates a huge bottleneck not only for productive research but also for clinical translation or any other real-world applications. The extent of this problem still remains much underappreciated. This also reflects a more general issue in academic research where too much focus is placed on chasing the statistical significance of theoretical constructs rather than on the effect sizes and their practical implications. It is starting to seem that in order to bring computational technologies to mental health we will have to simultaneously fix how academic research is done.

Philosophically, my work is grounded in scientific instrumentalism, which can be summarized as "all models are wrong, but some are useful". Instead of chasing "explanations" and trying to determine the "existence" of things (which are tightly connected to hypothesis testing and p-values), instrumentalism urges us to be more practical in operationalizing our constructs, to focus on the magnitude of the effects that we are studying, and to have clarity on how it all contributes to the ultimate goal: improving the quality of life. The only real knowledge is useful knowledge.
