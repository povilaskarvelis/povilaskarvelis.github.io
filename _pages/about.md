I am a postdoctoral research fellow at the [Krembil Centre for Neuroinformatics](https://www.camh.ca/en/science-and-research/institutes-and-centres/krembil-centre-for-neuroinformatics) at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, in Toronto, Canada.

I work on the development of computational models with the aim to re-conceptualize mental disorders and their treatment. I am driven by a vision of a multidisciplinary and personalized model of mental health that is aligned with a proper understanding of human nature. 

My most recent work addresses methodological challenges in studying individual differences and validating novel psychometric instruments. Many routinely used cognitive tests show poor reliability and construct validity, which creates a huge bottleneck not only for productive research but also for clinical translation or any other real-world applications. The extent of this problem remains very much underappreciated, and it continues to undermine many ongoing research efforts. This also reflects a more general issue in academic research where too much emphasis is placed on statistical significance and not enough on effects sizes, predictive power, and practical implications. It is starting to seem that in order to bring computational technologies to mental health we will have to simultaneously reinvent academic research.

More generally, I am interested in using computational tools to solve real-world problems while simultaneously tackling fundamental questions about the mind, intelligence, and knowledge. For example, I am interested in developing effective ways of integrating AI into the process of knowledge generation, building online research platforms that can speed up the research cycle and ensure reproducibility, establishing an instrumentalist framework for operationalizing complicated concepts such as free will and consciousness, etc.
