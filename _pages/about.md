I am a postdoctoral research fellow in the [Cognitive Network Modelling Lab](https://cognemo.com) at the [Krembil Centre for Neuroinformatics](https://www.camh.ca/en/science-and-research/institutes-and-centres/krembil-centre-for-neuroinformatics) at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, in Toronto, Canada.

I develop computational models with the aim to re-conceptualize mental disorders and their treatment. I am driven by a vision of a multidisciplinary and personalized model of mental health that is aligned with a proper understanding of human nature.

My recent work tackles methodological challenges in studying individual differences and validating novel psychometric instruments. Many widely used cognitive tests suffer from poor reliability and construct validity, creating a major bottleneck for both research and clinical translation. Despite its far-reaching implications, these issues remain largely overlooked. I believe it stems from broader systemic problems in academic research, where chasing statistical significance often diverts attention away from effect sizes, predictive power, and practical impact. By addressing these root problems, I aim to amplify the efficiency and impact of all other research.

More generally, I am interested in using computational tools to solve real-world problems while simultaneously exploring fundamental questions about the mind, intelligence, and knowledge.
