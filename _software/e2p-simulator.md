E2P Simulator (Effect-to-Prediction Simulator) is an open-source web simulation engine for evaluating real-world utility of biomarkers and prediction models. It addresses critical gaps in research practices by placing measurement reliability and outcome base rates at the center of the interpretation of findings and research planning.

More specifically, E2P Simulator allows researchers to explore the relationships among effect size (Cohen's d, Pearson's r, Odds Ratios), discriminative ability (ROC-AUC, sensitivity, specificity), real-world predictive value (PPV, NPV, PR-AUC), and clinical utility measures (Net Benefit), while visually conveying how all of them relate to the same underlying data distribution. It also includes multivariable simulators to estimate performance when combining multiple predictors, sample size calculators for training multivariable models, and a module for exploring how changes in measurement reliability and outcome base rates affect model calibration. 

Similar to how power analysis tools (such as [G*Power](https://www.psychologie.hhu.de/arbeitsgruppen/allgemeine-psychologie-und-arbeitspsychologie/gpower)) help researchers plan for statistical significance, E2P Simulator helps plan for practical significance. This enables more informed research decisions and efficient resource allocation in precision medicine, psychiatry, and other fields focused on predictive modeling and personalization.
