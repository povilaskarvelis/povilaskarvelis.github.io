The E2P Simulator (Effect-to-Prediction Simulator) is an interactive web-based tool designed to help researchers translate effect sizes into predictive utility. It visually and quantitatively demonstrates the relationship between commonly reported statistical metrics (such as Cohen's d and Pearson's r) and predictive metrics (such as AUC and PR-AUC), while accounting for real-world factors like measurement reliability and outcome base rates. Much like how power analysis tools (such as G*Power) help researchers plan for statistical significance, the E2P Simulator helps plan for practical significance.
